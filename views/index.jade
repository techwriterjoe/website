                | Miners are paid Elastic Coins (ELC) for directing their processing power towards arbitrary user-provided tasks instead of wasting energy on calculating Bitcoin's proof-of-work function. In fact, Bitcoin mining burns around 7000 MW daily - equaling the power output of one large nuclear power plant.

                | Scientists and businesses that require on-demand computing power can use Elastic's SDK in order to develop their tasks. Those tasks are submitted to the Elastic network and then worked off by the miners. Developers have immense amounts of computational resources right at their fingertips.

                | Elastic claims that the price for computational power is market driven. Think of it as an auction where buyers of computational resources (such as scientists) outbid each other to have their work solved. This is very profitable for the miners.
